# Music Synthesizer

This repository contains code for the Envison Project Music Synthesizer

In the recent years efforts have been made to synthesize music using computers instead of musical 
instruments. These efforts have led to creation of algorithms which can be used to make sound of musical instruments. One such algorithm is the Karplus strong algorithm. This algorithm can produce sound of stringed instruments like guitar. It mimics the mechanics of the string of a stringed instrument. In this project we have used this algorithm in two different ways.
